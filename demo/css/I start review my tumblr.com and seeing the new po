I get to my work between nine o'clock and twenty past nine.
I start review my tumblr.com and seeing the new posts.
And then I check my e-mails and tasks tha I have assigned.
Later I begin with my work.
At one o'clock I go to lunch and maybe I take a walk to anywhere.

Back to work I continue with my work but at half past three I take a break until a quarter to 4 four at ten to four.
My boss let me go at 6 o'clock because I study.
That is my work day.
